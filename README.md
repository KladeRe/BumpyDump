# Multibump
An over-engineered real-time browser multiplayer game. The players bump into each other and other things in an attempt to reach the goal first.

The current implementation is designed with two players in mind, however, it allows more players at the same time.

## Requirements

Docker Compose needs to be installed for a local setup to work. Installation instructions can be found here: [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Running the app

The app can be run using Docker Compose with the command:
```bash
docker compose up
```

The app should be visible by going to the URL at [http://localhost:7978](http://localhost:7978)

The current implementation doesn't need any environment variables.
